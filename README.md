Weather Station Work
I am developing iterative weather station designs using Raspberry Pi, Node.js, and Azure IoT.

The basic design was built on this tutorial: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station/0
I purchased mechanical sensors from Argent Data: https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=145
I purchased electronic sensors from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/
